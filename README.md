This is more or less a copy of David R. Hansons git repository with the
source code of his book "C Interfaces and Implementations: Techniques for
Creating Reusable Software".

I partially reformatted the source code to my liking and deleted the WIN32
specific code.

A simple makefile allows to produce a static and a shared library of this
source code.
